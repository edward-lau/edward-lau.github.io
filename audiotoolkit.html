				<div class = "title"> <p>Unity Audio Toolkit </p> </div>
				<p>Designed and programmed a set of audio tools in C# for the Unity engine that allows sound designers to create audio events and customize their behaviours. I started this project to learn about scripting audio logic and to have a set of tools available when middleware isn't an option.
				</p>
				<div class = "subtitle"> <p>Features </p> </div>
				<p>Play, stop, pause or unpause audio events throughout the entire scene or at specific game objects.
				</p>
				<p>Limit instances using the toolkit’s own priority and virtual voice system. It determines whether sounds are played or virtualized using a combination of distance scaled priority and instance limit settings (global, local and within radius).
				</p>
				<p>Add variation to sounds using randomized parameters and weighted random audio clip selection.
				</p>
				<p>Control audio behaviours such as playback probability, random positioning and repeating events.
				</p>
				<p>Third person  attenuation mode that positions audio emitters so that they're panned according to the listener (ie. the camera) and attenuated based on distance from an attenuator position (ie. the player character).
				</p>
				<p>
				Real-time parameter control for volume, pitch, low and high pass filters.
